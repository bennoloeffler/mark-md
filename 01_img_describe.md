## Bengal Tiger

The Bengal tiger, scientifically known as *Panthera tigris tigris*, is one of the largest and most iconic tiger subspecies. Native to the Indian subcontinent, these tigers are known for their striking orange coat with black stripes, which help them blend into the dense forest habitats. Bengal tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on large ungulates such as deer and wild boar. They are solitary and territorial animals, typically marking their territory with scent markings and other signals. Tragically, Bengal tigers are listed as endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are crucial to ensure their survival in the wild.
